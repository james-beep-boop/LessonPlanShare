# Lesson Plan Exchange — Deployment Guide for DreamHost

This guide walks you through setting up the project from scratch and deploying
it to DreamHost shared hosting at www.sheql.com.

**Important:** This GitHub repository contains only the custom application files
(controllers, models, views, routes, migrations, etc.). It is **not** a complete
Laravel project by itself — it does not include `composer.json`, `artisan`,
`bootstrap/`, `config/`, or `vendor/`. You must first create a fresh Laravel
project (Part 1, Step 1), then copy these files into it (Step 4). The result
is a full, deployable Laravel application that you push to GitHub and clone
onto your server.

## BEFORE YOU START: Credentials Checklist

You will need the following credentials during setup. Gather them as you go
through the DreamHost panel — they all go into the `.env` file on your server
(which is excluded from git and never shared publicly).

| Credential | Where to create it | Value |
|---|---|---|
| SSH username | DreamHost Panel > Users > Manage Users (set to "Shell user") | `david_sheql` |
| SSH server | Shown on the Manage Users page | `sheql.com` |
| MySQL hostname | Created when you add a database | `mysql.sheql.com` |
| MySQL database name | Websites > MySQL Databases > Add New | `sheql_lessons` |
| MySQL username | Created with the database | `sheql_dbuser` |
| MySQL password | You set this when creating the DB user | (stored in `.env` only) |
| SMTP email address | Mail > Manage Email > Create Address | `david@sheql.com` |
| SMTP password | You set this when creating the email | (stored in `.env` only) |
| APP_KEY | Auto-generated by `php artisan key:generate` | (don't set manually) |

**Passwords are stored only in the `.env` file on your server** (which is
excluded from git and never shared publicly).

## PART 1: LOCAL SETUP (on your own computer)

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.4 installed locally (check with `php -v`)
- Composer installed (https://getcomposer.org)
- A terminal/command prompt

### Step 1: Create the Laravel project

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel LessonPlanShare
cd LessonPlanShare
```

### Step 2: Install Laravel Breeze (authentication)

```bash
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
php artisan breeze:install blade
```

When Breeze asks about options, choose the defaults (Blade with Tailwind).
Breeze will try to run `npm install && npm run build`. This will fail if you
don't have Node.js — that's OK. We'll replace the Vite/Tailwind setup with CDN.

### Step 3: Replace Vite with Tailwind CDN

Breeze generates layout files that use `@vite`. We need to remove those.

Open `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` and `guest.blade.php`.
Delete any lines containing `@vite(...)`.

Then, our custom `components/layout.blade.php` (provided in this package)
already includes Tailwind via CDN and Alpine.js via CDN, so you'll use
`<x-layout>` in all our custom views instead of Breeze's `<x-app-layout>`.

### Step 4: Copy in the custom files

From this package, copy these files into your Laravel project, overwriting
where indicated:

```
COPY FROM THIS PACKAGE              →  TO YOUR LARAVEL PROJECT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
app/Models/User.php                  →  app/Models/User.php (REPLACE)
app/Models/LessonPlan.php            →  app/Models/LessonPlan.php (NEW)
app/Models/Vote.php                  →  app/Models/Vote.php (NEW)

app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php  →  (REPLACE Breeze's)
app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php            →  (NEW)
app/Http/Controllers/LessonPlanController.php           →  (NEW)
app/Http/Controllers/VoteController.php                 →  (NEW)

app/Http/Requests/StoreLessonPlanRequest.php            →  (NEW)

app/Mail/LessonPlanUploaded.php                         →  (NEW)
app/Mail/DuplicateContentRemoved.php                    →  (NEW)

app/Console/Commands/DetectDuplicateContent.php         →  (NEW)

database/migrations/2024_01_01_000001_create_lesson_plans_table.php  →  (NEW)
database/migrations/2024_01_01_000002_create_ratings_table.php       →  (NEW, creates votes table)

resources/views/components/layout.blade.php             →  (NEW)
resources/views/components/vote-buttons.blade.php       →  (NEW)
resources/views/dashboard.blade.php                     →  (REPLACE Breeze's)
resources/views/lesson-plans/create.blade.php           →  (NEW)
resources/views/lesson-plans/show.blade.php             →  (NEW)
resources/views/lesson-plans/edit.blade.php             →  (NEW)
resources/views/lesson-plans/my-plans.blade.php         →  (NEW)
resources/views/emails/lesson-plan-uploaded.blade.php   →  (NEW)
resources/views/emails/duplicate-content-removed.blade.php  →  (NEW)

routes/web.php                                          →  (REPLACE)
.gitignore                                              →  (REPLACE)
.env.example                                            →  (REPLACE)
```

### Step 5: Update Breeze auth views to use our layout

Breeze generates auth views in `resources/views/auth/`. These use
`<x-guest-layout>`. You have two options:

**Option A (Quick):** Edit each auth view and change `<x-guest-layout>` to
`<x-layout>` and `</x-guest-layout>` to `</x-layout>`.

**Option B (Thorough):** Keep Breeze's guest layout but update it to use
Tailwind CDN instead of @vite. Open `resources/views/layouts/guest.blade.php`
and replace the `<head>` contents with:
```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>{{ config('app.name') }}</title>
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<script defer src="https://unpkg.com/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
```

**Note about registration:** Our custom `RegisteredUserController` has a single
"Username" field that must be a valid email address. The submitted value is stored
in both the `name` and `email` columns automatically — there is no separate name
field. The sign-up form is in the Alpine.js modal in `layout.blade.php`, so
Breeze's standalone auth views are only used as a fallback.

### Step 6: Configure your local .env

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Edit `.env` and set your local database credentials. Then:

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan storage:link
php artisan serve
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 — you should see the dashboard.

### Step 7: Test locally

1. Register a test account (click Sign In → Sign Up; the username must be a valid email)
2. Upload a lesson plan — you should see a dialog box confirming the upload
   and showing the renamed filename (e.g., `AP-Biology_Day5_you@email.com_20260221_143022UTC.pdf`)
3. Check your email (if SMTP is configured locally) for the upload confirmation
4. View the plan, download it
5. Create a new version of it
6. Register a second test account and vote on the plan (upvote/downvote)
7. Search and sort on the dashboard
8. Run the duplicate detection command: `php artisan lessons:detect-duplicates --dry-run`

---

## PART 2: DREAMHOST SETUP

### Step 1: Set PHP version to 8.4

1. Log into your DreamHost Panel (https://panel.dreamhost.com)
2. Go to **Websites > Manage Websites**
3. Find sheql.com and click **Manage**
4. Under **PHP**, select **PHP 8.4**
5. Save changes

### Step 2: Enable SSH access for your user

1. Go to **Users > Manage Users**
2. Find the user associated with sheql.com (or create a new one)
3. Make sure the user type is set to **Shell user** (not "SFTP only")
4. Note down the username — you'll use this for all SSH commands below

### Step 3: Create a MySQL database

1. Go to **Websites > MySQL Databases**
2. Click **Add New Database**
3. Set a database name (e.g., `sheql_lessons`)
4. Create a new database user with a strong password, or use an existing one
5. The panel will assign a hostname — note it down (typically `mysql.sheql.com`)
6. Write down all four values: hostname, database name, username, password

### Step 4: Create an email address for SMTP

The application sends email for: password resets, upload confirmations (when a
teacher uploads a lesson plan), and duplicate-content removal notifications.

1. Go to **Mail > Manage Email**
2. Under sheql.com, click **Create Address**
3. The address `david@sheql.com` has been created for this purpose
4. Note down the password

The SMTP settings for DreamHost email are:
- Host: `mail.sheql.com`
- Port: `587`
- Encryption: `TLS`
- Username: `david@sheql.com` (the full email address)
- Password: (what you set when creating the address)

### Step 5: Back up and clear the existing site

The existing content at www.sheql.com needs to be moved out of the way.
SSH into your server:

```bash
ssh david_sheql@sheql.com
```

Then rename the existing web directory to keep it as a backup:

```bash
mv ~/sheql.com ~/sheql.com.old
```

(Don't delete it yet — you can remove it later once the new site is confirmed
working. To delete it when ready: `rm -rf ~/sheql.com.old`)

### Step 6: Install Composer on DreamHost

DreamHost doesn't always have Composer pre-installed. Install it in your
home directory:

```bash
cd ~
php -r "copy('https://composer.github.io/installer.sig', 'installer.sig');"
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (trim(file_get_contents('installer.sig')) !== hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php')) { echo 'ERROR: Invalid installer signature' . PHP_EOL; unlink('composer-setup.php'); unlink('installer.sig'); exit(1); }"
php composer-setup.php --quiet
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php'); unlink('installer.sig');"
```

Now `~/composer.phar` is your Composer. Create an alias so you can just
type `composer`:

```bash
echo 'alias composer="php ~/composer.phar"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify it works:
```bash
composer --version
```

### Step 7: Create a fresh Laravel project on the server

The GitHub repository only contains custom files (not a full Laravel project).
Create the project on the server, then overlay our custom files.

```bash
cd ~
composer create-project laravel/laravel LessonPlanShare
cd LessonPlanShare
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
php artisan breeze:install blade
```

Breeze may try to run `npm install` — that will fail on DreamHost (no Node.js).
This is fine. We use Tailwind CDN and don't need a build step.

### Step 8: Clone the custom files and overlay them

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/james-beep-boop/LessonPlanShare.git LessonPlanCustom
```

(Replace with your actual repository URL. If it's a private repo, you'll
need to set up a GitHub personal access token or SSH key — see Troubleshooting.)

Now copy the custom files into the Laravel project, overwriting where needed:

```bash
cp -r ~/LessonPlanCustom/LessonPlanShare/* ~/LessonPlanShare/
cp ~/LessonPlanCustom/LessonPlanShare/.env.example ~/LessonPlanShare/.env.example
cp ~/LessonPlanCustom/LessonPlanShare/.gitignore ~/LessonPlanShare/.gitignore
```

You can remove the cloned repo after copying:
```bash
rm -rf ~/LessonPlanCustom
```

### Step 9: Install dependencies and configure .env

```bash
cd ~/LessonPlanShare
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Fill in your actual credentials from the checklist above:

```
APP_NAME="Lesson Plan Exchange"
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://www.sheql.com

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql.sheql.com
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=sheql_lessons
DB_USERNAME=sheql_dbuser
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password_here

SESSION_DRIVER=file
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax

MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mail.sheql.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=david@sheql.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password_here
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="david@sheql.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Lesson Plan Exchange"
```

Save the file (in nano: Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X), then generate the app key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### Step 10: Run database migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Type `yes` when it asks to confirm running in production.

### Step 11: Point the domain to Laravel's public folder

```bash
ln -s ~/LessonPlanShare/public ~/sheql.com
```

This creates the `sheql.com` directory as a symlink to Laravel's public folder,
which is what DreamHost's web server will serve.

### Step 12: Create the storage symlink

```bash
cd ~/LessonPlanShare
php artisan storage:link
```

If that gives an error, create it manually:
```bash
ln -s ~/LessonPlanShare/storage/app/public ~/sheql.com/storage
```

### Step 13: Set permissions

```bash
chmod -R 775 ~/LessonPlanShare/storage
chmod -R 775 ~/LessonPlanShare/bootstrap/cache
```

### Step 14: Create the lessons upload directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/LessonPlanShare/storage/app/public/lessons
chmod 775 ~/LessonPlanShare/storage/app/public/lessons
```

### Step 15: Clear and rebuild caches for production

```bash
cd ~/LessonPlanShare
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

### Step 16: Set up the duplicate-content detection cron job

This command scans for lesson plans with identical file content (by SHA-256
hash), removes duplicates (keeping the earlier upload), and emails the affected
author. Set it to run daily:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line (runs at 2:00 AM server time daily):

```
0 2 * * * cd ~/LessonPlanShare && /usr/local/php84/bin/php artisan lessons:detect-duplicates >> ~/LessonPlanShare/storage/logs/dedup.log 2>&1
```

**Note:** The exact PHP path may vary on DreamHost. Check with:
```bash
which php
```
Use whatever path that returns (e.g., `/usr/local/php84/bin/php`).

You can also run it manually any time:
```bash
cd ~/LessonPlanShare
php artisan lessons:detect-duplicates --dry-run   # preview only
php artisan lessons:detect-duplicates             # actually delete duplicates
```

### Step 17: Test!

Visit https://www.sheql.com in your browser. You should see the dashboard.

Try registering an account. When you upload a lesson plan, you should see
a dialog box showing the canonical filename, and you should receive a
confirmation email at the address you registered with (if SMTP is configured
correctly).

## PART 3: ONGOING MAINTENANCE

### Updating the site after code changes

When you push changes to GitHub and want to deploy them:

```bash
ssh david_sheql@sheql.com
cd ~/LessonPlanShare
git pull

composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
php artisan migrate
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

### Monitoring disk usage

Uploaded lesson plan files go to `storage/app/public/lessons/`.
Monitor with:
```bash
du -sh ~/LessonPlanShare/storage/app/public/lessons/
```

### Database backups

```bash
mysqldump -h mysql.sheql.com -u sheql_dbuser -p sheql_lessons > ~/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### Checking duplicate detection logs

```bash
cat ~/LessonPlanShare/storage/logs/dedup.log
```

### Cleaning up the old site

Once the new site is confirmed working and you no longer need the old content:
```bash
rm -rf ~/sheql.com.old
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**500 Error / Blank page:**
- Check the log: `tail -50 ~/LessonPlanShare/storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Temporarily enable debug mode: edit `.env`, set `APP_DEBUG=true`, then run
  `php artisan optimize:clear` (this clears the config cache so the change
  takes effect)
- Verify permissions: `chmod -R 775 ~/LessonPlanShare/storage ~/LessonPlanShare/bootstrap/cache`
- After fixing, set `APP_DEBUG=false` and rebuild caches:
  `php artisan optimize:clear && php artisan config:cache && php artisan route:cache && php artisan view:cache`

**CSS not loading / page looks broken:**
- Make sure you removed all `@vite(...)` references from Breeze layout files
- Our layout uses Tailwind CDN — no build step needed

**File uploads not working:**
- Check that the directory exists: `ls -la ~/LessonPlanShare/storage/app/public/lessons/`
- Verify the storage symlink: `ls -la ~/sheql.com/storage`
- Check PHP's upload limit in DreamHost panel (should be >= 10M)
- You can also add a `.user.ini` in your web directory:
  ```
  upload_max_filesize = 12M
  post_max_size = 13M
  ```

**"Class not found" errors:**
- Run `composer dump-autoload` on the server

**Database connection refused:**
- Double-check DB_HOST — DreamHost uses `mysql.yourdomain.com`, not `localhost`
- Verify credentials by testing manually: `mysql -h mysql.sheql.com -u sheql_dbuser -p`

**Email not sending (upload confirmations or password resets don't arrive):**
- Verify SMTP credentials by checking if you can log into webmail at
  https://webmail.sheql.com with the `david@sheql.com` address
- Check the Laravel log for mail errors: `tail -20 ~/LessonPlanShare/storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Make sure MAIL_ENCRYPTION is set to `tls` (not `ssl`)
- DreamHost SMTP username must be the full email address, not just the local part
- Upload confirmations are wrapped in try/catch, so a mail failure won't block
  the upload — but you can check the log for "Upload confirmation email failed"

**Permission denied on SSH:**
- Make sure your user is set to "Shell user" (not SFTP) in DreamHost panel
- Try connecting with: `ssh -v david_sheql@sheql.com` for verbose output

**Git clone fails (private repo):**
- Generate a personal access token on GitHub: Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
- Use it as the password when prompted during `git clone`
- Or set up an SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` then add the public key to GitHub

**`.env` changes not taking effect:**
- If you previously ran `php artisan config:cache`, Laravel reads from the
  cached config and ignores `.env`. You must clear the cache first:
  `php artisan optimize:clear` then rebuild with `php artisan config:cache`

**Duplicate detection cron not running:**
- Verify the cron entry: `crontab -l`
- Check the PHP path is correct: `which php`
- Look at the log: `cat ~/LessonPlanShare/storage/logs/dedup.log`
- Test manually: `cd ~/LessonPlanShare && php artisan lessons:detect-duplicates --dry-run`

---

## PRODUCTION SECURITY CHECKLIST

After deployment, verify these settings are in place:

- `APP_ENV=production` in `.env`
- `APP_DEBUG=false` in `.env`
- `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true` in `.env` (requires HTTPS)
- `SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax` in `.env`
- `.env` file is **not** committed to git (check with `git status`)
- `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` are writable (775)
- Config cache is rebuilt after any `.env` change
- Cron uses absolute paths (check with `crontab -l`)
